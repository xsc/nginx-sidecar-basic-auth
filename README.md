This is a Docker image that provides an [nginx][nginx] proxy server enforcing
HTTP basic authentication on every request (exception `OPTIONS`). It is suitable
for operation within [OpenShift][openshift], e.g. as a sidecar container.

## Usage

### Docker

Start the container and link it with your backend (alternatively, use Docker
networks):

```sh
docker run -d --name nginx-basic-auth -p 8087:8087 \
  --link backend:backend \
  -e FORWARD_HOST=backend \
  -e FORWARD_PORT=3000 \
  xscys/nginx-sidecar-basic-auth
```

### OpenShift Sidecar Usage

Add the sidecar container next to your application container in your deployment
configuration:

```yaml
- image: xscys/nginx-sidecar-basic-auth
  imagePullPolicy: Always
  name: auth-proxy
  ports:
    - containerPort: 8087
      protocol: TCP
  env:
    - name: FORWARD_PORT
      value: ${BACKEND_CONTAINER_PORT}
```
